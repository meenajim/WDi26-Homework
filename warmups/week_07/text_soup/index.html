    Sometimes, the feeling is right
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet
Summertime love in the moonlight
Ah yippie yi yu
Ah yippie yi yeah
Ah yippie yi yu ah
Now the summer is gone
You had to go back home
Please come and see me again
I've never felt more alone
Baby, I am missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you'll miss me too
Come back and stay
I think about you every day
I really want you too
You swept my feet right off the ground,
You're the love I found
Doctor Jones, Jones,
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones,
Get up now
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones,
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones,
Wake up now
Wake up now
Ah yippie yi yu
Ah yippie yi yeah
Ah yippie yi yu ah
Ah yippieâ€¦
